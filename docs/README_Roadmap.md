### Tasks that may or may not make it into the plugin, but i am researching as time permits(not in any order)
- [ ] Context click copy image to clipboard
- [ ] Ability to zoom in and out the focus image
- [ ] Non-svelte version of the active gallery so I can include the modern features I've added to the rest of the plugin (and remove my svelte dependency entirely)
- [ ] Remote embeds getting right click and meta file support(maybe show in gallery too, but I don't know how yet)
- [ ] Templater support in meta templates
- [ ] Option to display a footer with some info for each image in the gallery
