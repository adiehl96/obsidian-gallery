## matchCase
default=false
Should tags be required to match case of the filter
## imgWidth
default= assigned in settings

## divAlign
default=left

## divHeight
default=0

## sort
default=unsorted
name: sort in order of file name
path: sort in order of file name, but grouped by file structure
cdate: sort by date the image file was added to this vault NOTE: in obsidian, files created on another machine have a cdate based on when they reached THIS machine
mdate: sort by date that the image's info file was last modified(if no info file falls back to last modified date of image itself)
size: sort by size of the file
## reverseOrder
default=false
Should image order be flipped
## customList
Specify images to display from the filtered list by their order in the list(not compatible with randomization)
